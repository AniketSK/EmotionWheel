An app to help you pick specifically what emotion you're feeling

## The Concept
Let's face it - emotions are hard. They can be intricate, messy, and intense - sometimes unfathomably so. It's no easy feat to be in tune with them. 

What exactly does it mean to feel "good" or "bad"? 

EmotionWheel uses language - an indispensible tool to communicate, not only with others but your own self - to help you narrow down to exactly what you're feeling. It starts with most vague emotions and breaks them into increasingly specific ones. 

You can keep going until you find the word that resonates the most what you're feeling, and there you have it. 

❤️
